                <p> If you are travelling from another city into Pittsburgh, and not using a car - your best option is to use Megabus. This is the bus that both Sandi and Conor have used throughout their many transAtlantic trips. Megabus has several bus routes into Pittsburgh that are relatively frequent and affordable.</p>

                </button>
                <p>The alternative bus option, would be the Greyhound bus. It would be a cheaper option, but is much less comfortable, more infrequent, and less direct.</p>

                <h4>Amtrak</h4>
                <p>The main reason why the bus is the best public transport option is because Amtrak has one train into Pittsburgh from New York a day, and it's much more expensive.</p>
